# Decrease Allowance Functionality

This functionality is available only for users using the **Client Smart Contract** (Contract allocation type).  
The **Decrease** option is available only when the application is in the **Granted** state.  

**Note:** The DataCap removed from the client will return directly to the contract, not the allocator's account. Subsequent allocations will first use the DataCap remaining on the contract and only then the allocator's DataCap.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Connect your wallet**  
   Make sure your wallet is connected to the application.

2. **Click "Decrease Client DataCap"**  
   A modal will appear after clicking.

5. **Check history and update**  
   - The decrease will be added to the application history.  
   - The **Total Allocation Amount** will be recalculated.  
   - The progress bar will indicate the last positive allocation and the client's available DataCap.
